**Python Exercises:**

1. **Loops and Functions:**
   Create a Python function that takes a text as input and counts the number of words in it. Use a loop to iterate through the words in the text.

2. **File Handling:**
   Write a Python script that reads the first story from a text file and displays it on the console. Create a function that takes the filename as an argument and returns the story as a string.

3. **Regular Expressions:**
   Using regular expressions, extract all the years (e.g., 2042, 2045) from the story text. Print the extracted years.

4. **Git Branch Merging Exercises:**

   Assume you have two branches: `feature-branch` and `main`. Perform the following Git exercises:

   - Create a new branch named `bugfix-branch` from `main`.
   - Make changes to a file in `bugfix-branch`.
   - Commit the changes in `bugfix-branch`.
   - Switch back to `main` branch and make changes to the same file.
   - Commit the changes in `main`.
   - Attempt to merge `bugfix-branch` into `main`.
   - Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur.
